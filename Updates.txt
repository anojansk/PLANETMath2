Updates on project, what needs to be fixed: 


FeedBackComp:
    1. Give a warning if not all stars in feedback has been clicked. Better than 
    to check later in FromDataBase. 
    
    2. Fix From DataBase such that: 
        - Fetching goes as expected. 
        - Calculate avarage s.t it can be displayed on right column. 
    
    3. Security rules in FireBase. 

    4. LagrangeCalc:
        - Inputs for interpolation points x and respective y values. 
        - buttons to Submit
        - Calculate in another Component
