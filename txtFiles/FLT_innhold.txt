Fermat's little theorem

In this section we will take a look at Fermat's little theorem and two corrollarrys that relates to this theorem. 
It states: 
	Let p be a prime and let a be an integer such that p (ikke deler) a then 
		a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)


Lets deep dive into this formula, this formula states that for an integer a if p does not divide a, in other words p =/= a * n, where n is also another integer then the formula above holds.


Another way of writing the formula above is:
	If p is a prime then a^p ≡ a (mod p)

In this case p can divide a (p deler a). If p does not divide a, then this is fermat's little theorem but with a multiplied on both sides. If p does divide a, then a^p ≡ 0 ≡ a (mod p), hence it works for both cases. 

Now lets look at a few examples:

1. Find the congruence of 18^13 (mod 13)
To find out if we can use FLT, we have to check is p|/a. Since p = 13 and a = 18, we have gcd(13,18) = 1, hence p|/a. 
From FLT we therefore know 18^13 ≡ 1 (mod 13).

2. Lets find the congruence of 
2^137 (mod 17)
To find this we have to see if we can apply fermat's little theorem we first have to see if gcd(2,17) = 1, which is true. Further, need to rewrite 2^137 such that a factor can be simplified. How can we simplify it? If we can write a part of 2^128 such that we get 2^16 then we can simplfy it to 1 because of Fermat's little theorem. 

2^137 = 2^(16*8+9) = 2^(16*8) * 2^9 = (2^16)^8 * 2^9 ≡ 1^8 *2^9 (mod 17) ≡ 512 (mod 17) ≡ 2 (mod 17)


3. What is the rest of 5^3197/7^2*13

this can be written as 
5^3186 ≡ ? (mod 637)
first we need to check if gcd(5,637) = 1, this is true. 
Now we want to find a way to rewrite 3197 such that we can simply a factor that contains the power of 637-1. 
5^3197 ≡ 5^636*5 * 5^6 (mod 637) ≡ (5^636)^5 * 5^6 (mod 637) ≡ 1^3 * 5^6 (mod 637) ≡ 15625 (mod 637) ≡ 337 (mod 637)
