In this section we will take a look at a few ways to do matrix calculations. The ones we will look at are: Addition/Subtraction and Multiplication. 


Addition/Subtraction: 

When Adding two matrices they have to be the same size that is; we can only add a nxn matrix to another nxn matrix. 
for instance: 3x3 + 3x3 is ok, 4x4 + 5x5 is not ok. 
Once we see that the size is the same, we add the element at place ij (where i is the row number and j is the column number) 
This same goes for subtraction. However remember that subtraction is not commutative. That is given matrix M and N, 
M - N =/= N - M, yet addition is (M + N = N + M). 

Here are a few examples:

Multiplication
For the explanation below assume the following:
Matrix M, N are both of size axa. 
Matrix O has size bxc
Matrix P has sie cxd


Multiplication between matrices of same size: 
Above we saw that adding two matrices together, all we had to do was to add the numbers on 
position ij together, where 1<=i,j<=a. That is, let a = 4, 
The value of position 1,4 in the matrix M+N, will be the value of the position 1,4 in M added to the value of the position 1,4 in N. 

However, when we multply a matrix of the same size, we don't do it this way. If we want to find M*N (again assuming M,N is a 4x4 matrix), the value in position ij (assume 1,4 again), will be the dot product between the row 1 in M and column 4 in N. This is shown below. 






Multiplication between matrices of different size: 



Multiplication of two or more matrices is different from addition/subtraction. 
When we do the addition operation between two matrices the matrices need to be the same size. 
However, for matrix multiplication that is not neccesary the case. Given matrices M and N, where M is
